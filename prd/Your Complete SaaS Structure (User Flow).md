### **Your Complete SaaS Structure (User Flow)**

Here is the flow and purpose of each domain:

**1\. mekarpad.com (Marketing / Landing Page)**

* **This is your "Storefront."**  
* This is your main landing page where your ICP Writers 3 sign up or log in.  
* Visitors see the marketing copy, /pricing, /compare, etc.

**2\. app.mekarpad.com (The Author Workspace)**

* **This is the "Workshop" or "Office."**  
* This is the private, logged-in backend for authors.  
* After logging in, this is where authors are taken.  
* This is where they use all the New Milestone 1 features \[model\]: "Author dashboard (My Books, Drafts, Published)," "Book creation," and "Chapter writing \+ editor."  
* **No reader can ever see this page.** It is purely the author's private tool.

**3\. authorname.mekarpad.com (The Public Author Home)**

* **This is the "Public Gallery" or "Portfolio."**  
* This is the *public result* of the work the author does in app.mekarpad.com.  
* This is the "professional author home" 4 that ICP Writers want.  
* If the author pays for the "Pro" plan, this becomes their custom domain (authorname.com)

**4\. books.mekarpad.com (The Discovery Catalog)**

* **This is the public "Bookstore" or "Mall."**  
* This is the *product* for your Reader ICP 6.  
* This is where readers discover new work  
* This catalog pulls data from the public books on authorname.mekarpad.com and displays them in the curated, "anti-algorithm" way you planned (e.g., "Completed" filters, "Niche" categories)8888.
