### **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**PRD MekarPad \[1/5\] SaaS Author Home MVP**

* **Owner:** Gilang R. Aprianto  
* **Status:** Draft  
* **Date:** November 13, 2025  
* **Related Docs:** Revised Milestone Plan, ICP \- MekarPad for Author 5

### **1\. Objective**

To launch the **commercial (paid) MVP** of MekarPad as a "SaaS Author Home" platform.

The goal of this milestone is to **achieve the fastest path to revenue** by exclusively serving the **Writer ICP (Persona A)** 6. We are prioritizing *SaaS & Branding* features ("payment triggers") 7 above all else. Community & Discovery features will be intentionally delayed to Milestone 2 (books.mekarpad.com).

### **2\. Target Audience (ICP)**

* **Primary Target (The Paying Customer):** "The Independent Fiction Professional" (ICP \- Author) 8.

* **ICP's Core Problem (Validated):**  
  1. They *know* they need a professional "Author Home" (website)9.

  2. They are *frustrated* because generic tools (Wix, Squarespace) are "difficult," "overwhelming" \[model, based on search\], and "not built for authors" \[model, based on search\].  
  3. They are *already paying* SaaS competitors ($9-$11/month) for inferior tools \[model, based on search\].  
* **ICP's Needs (Payment Triggers):** "Significant author branding & control (e.g., custom domain, author home)" 1010, a "clean, minimalist, and professional" experience 1111, and a "structure designed for fiction"12.

### **3\. Features & Scope**

This scope defines the "Writer" (Free) tier for acquisition and the "Pro" (Paid) tier for monetization.

#### **Epic 1: Core Authoring & Platform (Free)**

The basic tools required for an author to write and publish.

| ID | User Story | Notes | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1.1 | As an author, I can register/login via magic link. | Fast, low-friction. | 13 |
| 1.2 | As an author, I can create and manage books (cover, title, synopsis). | Basic book management. | 14 |
| 1.3 | As an author, I can write, edit, and publish chapters in a "calm" and "focused" editor. | The core product. Serves ICP value of "Calm & Focus". | 1515151515151515 |
| 1.4 | As a reader, I can read the public book page in a clean, ad-free layout. | Key to the "clean... experience" promise. | 16161616 |

#### **Epic 2: The "Free" Author Home (Free)**

The basic "Author Home" features. This is the *teaser* for the Pro plan.

| ID | User Story | Notes | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2.1 | As an author, I can create a public profile page (bio, photo, social links). | Part of "author identity". | 17171717 |
| 2.2 | As an author, I can have a myname.mekarpad.com subdomain. | Establishes the "author home". | 18 |
| 2.3 | As an author, I can choose from 1-2 "Standard" themes for my page. | Basic customization. | 19 |

#### **Epic 3: The "Pro" SaaS Features (Paid \- Payment Triggers)**

These are the features that directly address the **Payment Triggers** of the ICP 20.

| ID | User Story | Notes | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 3.1 | As a Pro author, I can connect my **custom domain** (myname.com). | **Payment Trigger \#1.** Pulled from M7. | 21212121 |
| 3.2 | As a Pro author, I can choose from exclusive **premium themes**. | **Payment Trigger \#2.** Pulled from M7. | 22222222 |
| 3.3 | As a Pro author, I can **remove "MekarPad" branding** from my site footer. | Key for "control" & "professional aesthetics". | 23232323 |
| 3.4 | As a Pro author, I can integrate my **newsletter** service (Mailchimp, ConvertKit) to capture emails. | Key independence feature. Pulled from M3. | 24 |

### **4\. Out of Scope (For M1)**

To keep this milestone lean and 100% focused on the SaaS goal, we are **intentionally not building** any community or discovery features.

* **NO "Simple feed / discover page"**25. This is the "trap" \[meta-ref\] that will repel our paying ICP. This will be built *separately* in Milestone 2 (books.mekarpad.com).

* **NO Social ("Noise") Features:** "Comments" 26, "Likes" 27, "Author follow system"28. These violate the "calm" promise29292929.

* **NO Marketplace or Coin Monetization** 30. Our business model is SaaS, not a marketplace.

### **5\. Success Metrics**

1. **Primary Metric (Goal):** Active **Pro** Subscribers.  
   * *Target:* Achieve \~150 paying subscribers to validate the business model and hit the financial target \[model, user\].  
2. **Acquisition Metric:** Number of **Free "Writer"** signups.  
3. **Conversion Metric:** Conversion rate from Free to Pro.
