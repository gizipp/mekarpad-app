### **🧭 Milestone Plan for MekarPad (SaaS-First Strategy)**

#### **Milestone 1 – SaaS MVP – "The Professional Author Home"**

**Goal:** Launch a *paid* product ($7/mo) focused on the Writer ICP. This solves their primary problem: a professional, "easy" author home built specifically for fiction \[model\].

**Deliverables:**

* User registration (Magic link login)  
* Author dashboard (My Books, Drafts, Published)  
* Book creation & Chapter editor (Core)  
* Public book view (Clean, 'calm' reading experience)  
* Author profile page with bio, photo, social links  
* Vanity URL / Subdomain support (author.mekarpad.com)  
* **\[PRO\]** **Custom domain mapping (authorname.com)**  
* **\[PRO\]** Premium author themes (Basic)  
* **\[PRO\]** Newsletter signup integration (Mailchimp, etc.)  
* **REMOVED:** "Simple feed / discover page" 12 (This is the "trap" that will repel your ICP)

**PRD:** PRD MekarPad \[1/5\] SaaS Author Home MVP

#### **Milestone 2 – Public Catalog (books.mekarpad.com)**

**Goal:** Launch a "Curated Catalog" (not a "feed") to attract the Reader ICP 13 and provide "fair discovery" for free writers (Persona B1). This is your *acquisition funnel*.

**Deliverables:**

* Separate catalog page (books.mekarpad.com)  
* **Reader ICP Feature:** "Status: Completed"   
* **Reader ICP Feature:** Niche Genre & Genre Exclusion filters  
* **Reader ICP Feature:** Editorial Curation  
* Search, filters, category views  
* Public book pages that link to the author's "Author Home"

**PRD:** PRD MekarPad \[2/5\] Curated Catalog (books.mekarpad.com)

#### **Milestone 3 – Advanced Pro Tools & Independence (SaaS Upgrade)**

**Goal:** Add more value to the paid SaaS package to increase retention and justify the $7-$11/month price point.

**Deliverables:**

* **\[PRO\]** **Manuscript export (EPUB/PDF)** (Pulled from M6; Key for "Independence")  
* **\[PRO\]** **Author-only analytics** (Pulled from M7)  
* **\[PRO\]** Page builder for authors (Simple) (Pulled from M7)  
* **\[PRO\]** Chapter locks (for email capture only) (Pulled from M3)

**PRD:** PRD MekarPad \[3/5\] Advanced Pro Tools (SaaS Upgrade)

#### **Milestone 4 – "Calm" Community Features (Opt-In)**

**Goal:** Add *optional* engagement features to serve Persona B1 without "polluting" the "calm" experience of the paying ICP (Persona A).

**Deliverables:**

* Comments or reactions per chapter (Optional, can be toggled off by author)  
* Author follow system (Optional, focus on notifications, not a "feed")  
* Book likes or bookmarks (Reader-focused, not a "viral" metric)

**PRD:** PRD MekarPad \[4/5\] Calm Community Layer

#### **Milestone 5 – Monetization & Distribution (Future Roadmap)**

**Goal:** Explore *direct* monetization (which the ICP prefers over "coins") and external distribution.

**Deliverables:**

* **DELAYED:** Coin/token purchase system (This is the Wattpad model, not the SaaS ICP model) 25  
* **REPLACE WITH:** Direct "Tipping" / Payment Integration (Lemon Squeezy, Stripe Connect)  
* **\[PRO\]** Distribution options: Amazon KDP, Google Books, etc. (Pulled from M6) 26
